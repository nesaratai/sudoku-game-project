# Sudoku Puzzle Game
Sudoku is a logic-based number puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with numbers from 1 to 9 so that each number appears only once in each row, column and each of the nine 3x3 subgrides (also know as "boxes")


#### **Basic Rules:**
1.	Each row must have numbers 1 to 9 without repeating.
2.	Each column must have numbers 1 to 9 without repeating.
3.	Each 3×3 box must have numbers 1 to 9 without repeating.


## How to play the Game!

1.	**Start with Easy Numbers:**
Begin by filling in the numbers that are obvious. For example, if a number can only go in one place in a row, column, or box, fill it in.
2.	**Look at Rows and Columns:**
Check each row and column to see where numbers are missing and where they can logically go without breaking the rules.
3.	**Use Process of Elimination:**
For each empty cell, check which numbers are already in the same row, column, and box. This will narrow down the possibilities.
4.	**Pencil In Possible Numbers:**
In more challenging puzzles, write down potential numbers lightly in each cell. This helps you keep track of possibilities and make better decisions as the puzzle progresses.
5.	**Look for Patterns and Strategies:**
Use advanced strategies like:
    *Naked Pairs/Triples: When two or three cells in a row, column, or box can only contain the same two or three numbers, those numbers can be eliminated from other cells in that area.*
